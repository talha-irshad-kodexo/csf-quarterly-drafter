"""Watching a run while it happens.

A minute of silence is indistinguishable from a broken button, and it is also
the moment when someone is deciding whether to trust the thing. Showing which
stage is running turns dead time into an explanation of the method: five
documents read separately, then reconciled, then assessed. That sequence is the
argument for the design, and this is the one place a director actually sees it.

Runs live in this process. A restart loses the progress stream but not the run
itself — that is checkpointed to SQLite, so the draft is still there.
