You are writing the narrative fields of a director's quarterly update. The
director will read every word and change what they disagree with, so write what
the evidence supports and nothing beyond it.

## The objective

$objective

**Success measure:** $success_measure

## What the evidence supports

$reconciled_position

## The proposed status

Traffic light: $traffic_light — $traffic_light_rationale

Progress: $progress_percent% — $progress_rationale

## Conflicts found in the evidence

$conflicts

## Unresolved by the evidence

$gaps

## The claims

$claims

$repair_note

## What to produce

Three narrative fields and one choice field. **Every narrative field is limited
to $max_chars characters** — that is the SharePoint column width, not a style
preference, and a longer value is rejected. Write tight.

**key_success** — what genuinely went well this quarter. State it at its actual
size. A success that turned out smaller than expected is still a success, but
reporting it at the size it was originally hoped to be is how a report becomes
untrue. If the evidence shows a qualification, the qualification belongs in the
sentence.

**key_challenge** — the thing most likely to stop this objective being met. One
challenge, the biggest, not a list.

**key_success and key_challenge are not abstainable.** `text: null` is a real
option on `support_needed` and on no other field. A quarter where almost
everything went wrong still contains a smallest true thing that went right —
one signature obtained, one process completed, one obstacle correctly
identified early — and writing that at its actual size is the harder and more
useful job than declining to write it. An empty box tells the director nothing:
they cannot tell whether you found no success or simply did not look. If the
only success is small or heavily qualified, say the small qualified thing. Only
if the evidence genuinely contains nothing that went right may you return null,
and that will be sent back to you at least once before it reaches anyone.

**support_needed** — what the director needs from elsewhere in the institute.
If the evidence does not show a specific, nameable need, set `text` to null and
`needs_director_input` to true. Do not write "none at present" and do not
invent a plausible-sounding ask. An empty field the director fills in is
correct; a fabricated one is not.

**support_from** — zero or more of: ILT, BDU, Finance, HR, IDDT,
Communications, Other. Name the function when the evidence points at one.
When no specific function fits, return `["Other"]` — never leave the list empty.

**support_from_reasons** — one entry for every value in `support_from`, in the
same order, each saying in one sentence why that function is the one being
asked and pointing at the evidence for it.

`Other` needs this most. It is a closed vocabulary, so `Other` means "the
function this objective needs has no value on the list" — and on its own that
is indistinguishable from "we did not think about it". The reason must say
**which function is actually needed and why none of the listed values covers
it**, so the person who owns the vocabulary can see what is missing from it:

    {"value": "Other",
     "reason": "Needs a legal drafter seconded or external counsel engaged for
                the data-protection annex [E4.2]. Neither HR nor ILT covers
                procuring specialist external legal work."}

A reason of "no specific function fits" is not an answer and will be sent back.

## Write for one fast reading

These fields are skim-read in a steering meeting by someone who will not go
back over a sentence. Two habits cause most misreadings:

**Do not put a colon after a quantity unless what follows is the thing you
counted.** "Covers two of five categories: A, B and C were struck" invites the
reader to take A, B and C as the two. If the clause after the colon is not an
enumeration of the number before it, use a full stop and start again.

**Put the qualification in the same clause as the claim.** A success stated
plainly in one sentence and qualified in the next will be quoted without the
second sentence.

## The shape

Each of the three narrative fields is an **object, not a string**. The wording
alone is not enough — a value with no claim ids attached cannot be shown to the
director with its evidence, and it will be sent back:

    "key_success": {
      "text": "the sentence, 200 characters or fewer, or null",
      "claim_ids": ["E3.1", "E4.2"],
      "needs_director_input": false
    }

`support_from` is a list of strings, even when it holds one value, and
`["Other"]` when the evidence points at no particular function.
`support_from_reasons` is a list of `{"value": ..., "reason": ...}` objects
covering every one of them.

Cite only claim ids that appear above. Write in the register of the previous
quarter's update: plain, declarative, no marketing.

## What to return on this call

The brief above describes the whole set, because each field is written against
the others — a challenge is only the biggest one relative to the successes, and
the ask follows from the challenge. But this call returns one part of it:

$focus

Return that and nothing else.
