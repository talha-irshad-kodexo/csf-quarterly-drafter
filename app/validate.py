No model involved. Everything here is a rule from the CSF extract section 3,
checked in Python, so a schema violation cannot reach the director's screen

Issues are split into repairable and non-repairable. Repairable issues (a
narrative over the character limit, say) send the graph back for another
attempt. Non-repairable ones are surfaced to the director rather than retried,
because silently trying again is how a workflow ends up hiding a real problem.
