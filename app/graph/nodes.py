"""The nodes.

The shape of the pipeline is: read each document on its own, reconcile what
they say against each other, assess status against the success measure, write
the narrative, validate, then stop and wait for the director.

Reading each document in isolation is deliberate. A reader that sees all five
at once tends to harmonise them into a single tidy account, which is exactly
the information we need to keep — the disagreements between documents are the
substance of this problem, not noise to be smoothed away. Reconciliation is a
separate pass with explicit rules for that reason.
